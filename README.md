Cycle-Trac is application that tracks playlists created for each cycling class. With this application, you are able to create a workout, and add songs to the workout. Each song has a title, duration, and summary of workout during that song (30 second sprints, increase resistance on bike, etc.). The homepage shows every workout that the user has created. Originally intended to be a web application written in Ruby, it is now currently being reworked into an iOS application.
